## Tournament design and evaluation

### What is Swiss-system tournament?

A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format which features a set number of rounds of competition,
but considerably fewer than in a round-robin tournament. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual)
does not play every other. Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to
ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once.

### Basic rules for Swiss Systems

- The number of rounds to be played is declared **beforehand**.

- Two players shall **not** play against each other more than once.

- The pairing rules must be such transparent that the person who is in charge for the pairing can explain them.

### Statement of the Theme

Write a program that reads an input value n, runs each of the three tournaments for ```2^n``` contestants,
and calculates the two statistics ```R``` and ```M```(p. 22) for each of the three pairs of orderings. Using the same ```n```, run the
experiment many times and calculate means for M and R. See if _Swiss tournaments_ or _single-elimination tournaments_
are more likely to replicate round robin results.
