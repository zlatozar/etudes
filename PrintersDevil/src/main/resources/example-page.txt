?papersize 42 40
?mode justify
This sample section of text will be set justified. Notice that
   the way    spaces are left  has  no effect
on     the output.
Only word separation is caused by spaces.
Thus, it is a good idea to start each source text sentence on a
new line to make editing easier.
?mode fill
In the fill mode,  spaces    still have no effect,
but now the words are all run close up and the right margin is
raggedy.
Research suggests that the ragged right  edge
may improve reading speed.
Notice also the paragraph break caused by ?mode.
?mode unfilled
This text   will be taken exactly  as
   seen and it   better  not  run
past      column    40.
?mode justify
?paragraph 10 2
Finally, the ?paragraph command causes a gap and an
indentation which looks like normal text.
The commands buried in these lines cause no problems because
the question marks are not in column 1.
